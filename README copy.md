# Rune2Word

Rune2Word is a mobile application that allows *Diablo II: Lord of Destruction* players to browse and find Rune Words. Rune Words can be filtered by item type (and by weapon class), number of sockets, and applicable runes.

## Development

This application was developed using [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/).

All of the data for this application is static in an exported TypeScript variable (found in `src/app/data/runeword-data.ts`). Because the game was released in 2001, and the data has not changed in a significant amount of time, I found this approach more feasible than creating an API.
